An example of a UDP Server using non blocking and asynchronous I/O.

Importance of such a server lies in the fact that in network communication
sending or receiving messages over internet is a time consuming affair.
If blocking I/O is used the program would have to wait idly and unfruitfully
for a longer amount of time utill a certain send or receive is accomplished successfully.

But using non blocking and asynchronous socket won't let that happen. Non blocking
socket would allow the program to do other jobs without being blocked by some
socket IO functions, whereas Asynchronous behavior will allow the program to
take care of matters when needed i.e. when a send or recv returns successfully
